# pandas-challenge -Module 4.
I created and manipulated Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data. For this reason, my folder contains three .pyipynb files and a .txt file:
1. PyCitySchools_starter : Instruction file.
2. PyCitySchools_Analisys : Analysis how to find the answers for each assigments.
3. PyCitySchools_checkpoints : Answers according to instructions.
4. PyCitySchools_Analisys: Written Report.


I could do the following: 
Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, create a report that includes the following data. Your report must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

I needed to use a hint that I had to check out the sample solution called PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb located in the .zip file to review the desired format for this assignment.
