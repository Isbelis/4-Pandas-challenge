# pandas-challenge -Module 4.
I created and manipulated Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data. For this reason, my folder contains three .pyipynb files and a .txt file:

PyCitySchools_starter : Instruction file.

PyCitySchools_Analisys : Analysis how to find the answers for each assignment.

PyCitySchools_checkpoints : Answers according to instructions.

PyCitySchools_Analisys: Written Report.

I did the following: 

Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, creating a report that includes the data according to instructions. My report must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.



I needed to use a hint that I had to check out the sample solution called PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb located in the .zip file to review the desired format for this assignment.
